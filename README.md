# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

**Run a local blockchain instance**
```shell
npx hardhat node
```

**Deploy a Contract to the local blockchain**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
